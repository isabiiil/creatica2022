It is a unfortunate truth that the United States healthcare system is inaccessible and exploitative. Both hospitals and big pharma overcharge for what should be considered a basic human right. Despite the state law that requires price transparency from hospitals, most institutions still have not abided by this law. This platform helps patients and their caretakers become well-informed about the prices of different procedures and medications, so they can make the best decision regarding their care.
